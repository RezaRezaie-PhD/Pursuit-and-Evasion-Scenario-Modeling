# Pursuit-and-Evasion-Scenario-Modeling
Pursuit and evasion is an important scenario in many applications with moving objects in the air (aircraft) or on the ground (vehicles). Modeling the behavior and trajectory of the pursuer and evador is essential, e.g., for tracking and trajectory prediction. Such a model is presented, simulated, and its performance is demonstrated.
